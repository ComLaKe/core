\chapter{Acknowledgment}
This work would not have been possible without open access,
Sci-Hub and Library Genesis.  In addition, Wikipedia was a great index
and summary for books and articles of certain topics.

Moreover, I would like to thank my colleagues and supervisors
for their feedbacks, collaborations and encouragements.  My family and friends
(both online and in-real-life) were also incredibly supportive.

\chapter{Acknowledgment}
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor,
Dr~\thesupervisor, who has been continuously
encouraging and pushing me out of my comfort zones and deliver better works,
while giving me a generous amount of freedom to make important design choices
and emphases.  It was also an honor to be working with my fellow interns,
who were really collaborative and not afraid of giving feedbacks and criticisms.

I also want to thank my friends, my family and my dog for being incredibly
supportive and putting up with me when I was not at my best.

This work would not have been possible without all the other works it depends
on, including various libraries and systems that are the results of countless
volunteer hours which are dedicated to the use of the free software community.
Open access, Sci-Hub and Library Genesis were also ultimately helpful
in providing theoretical knowledges and past research findings.  In addition,
Wikipedia was a great index to find these books and articles in the first place.

Finally, it is important to acknowledge the services that were provided
free-of-charge or at a very little cost including, but not exclusive to,
GitHub for source code and document hosting, \https{sr.ht} for its futuristic
\gls{ci} service, \https{Matrix.org} and Slack for instant messaging,
and Google Meet for weekly video conferencing.

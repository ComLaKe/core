\section{Results}
Quantity-wise, the internship has delivered
all expected outcomes and functional requirements.  In summary,
requirement analysis, architecture, design and implementation
of ComLake core were completed.  The \gls{api} was sufficiently
documented\footnote{\url{https://comlake.github.io/comlake.core/api.html}}
for other components to integrate with.
